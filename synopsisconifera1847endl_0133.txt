„minute flexible. — Reaehing 180 feet high and 6 feet diametre.
„Leaves from 1—4th to one ineh long, but all 1—10th wide. Is
„it a variety of the Spruce-Fir?“ Raf.

„The second is a much more common speeies, and constitutes
„at least one half of the timber in this neighbourhood. Is seems
„to resemble a Spruee, rising from one hundred and sixty to
„one hundred and eighty feet, and is from four to six in dia-
„meter, straight, round and regularly tapering. The bark is
„thin‚ of a dark colour, much divided in small longitudinal in-
„terstices: the bark of the boughs and young trees is somewhat
„smooth, but not equal to the balsam fir: the wood is white,
„very soft, but difficult to rive: the trunk is a simple, bran-
„ching and diffuse stem, not so proliferous as the pines and firs
„usually are. It puts forth buds from the sides of the small
„hung-hs, as well as from their extremities: the stem terminates
„like the Cedar, in a slender pointed top. The leaves are petio-
⁷,late, the footstalks short, acerose, rather more than half a.
„line in width, and very unequal in length, the greatest length
„seldom exceed a quarter of an inch. The leaf has a small lon-
„gitudinal ehannel on the upper disk, which is of a deep and
„glossy green, while the under disk is of a whitish green only:
„it yields but little rosin. that is remarkable, the cone is not
„longer than the end of a man’s thumb, it is soft, ssexible, of
„an ovate form, and produced at the ends of the small twigs.“

„Clarke], branches bullate balsamiferous, leaves densely scat-
„tered, forming 3 rows, sessile, lanceolate, obtuse, flexible, sul-
„cate and shining above, gibbous beneath. Reaehing 100 feet
„high 3 blisters on the branehes filled with a fine aromatie bal-
„sam. Leaves very small, 1—8th of an ineh long, 1—16th
„wide.“ Raf.

„The third species resembles in all points.the Canadian Bal-
„sam-Fir. It grows from two and a. half to four feet in dia-
„meter, and rises to the height of eighty or one hundred feet.
„The stem is simple branehing and proliferous, its leaves are
„sessile, aceruus, one eighth of an inch in length, and one six-
„teenth in width, thickly seattered on the twigs, and adhere to

„off in thiu rolling flakes. It yields but little balsam: two-thirds
„of the diameter of the trunk in the eentre , presents a reddish
„white5 the remainder is white, porous and tough: the twigs
„are much longer and more slender tha-n in either of the other
„speeies3 the leaves are acerose, one twentieth of an ineh in
„width, and one inch in length3 sessile, inserted on all sides of
„the bough, straight, and obliquely pointing towards the extre-
„mities. 'Phe upper disk has a small longitudinal channal, and
„is of a deep green, and not-so glossy as the balsam Fir. 'Phe
„under disk is of a pale green. —- We have seen a speeies of this
„Fir on low marshy grounds, resembling. in all points the fore-
„going, except that it branches more diffusively. This tree is
„generally thirty feet in height, and two in diameter. The dif-
„fusion of its branehes may result from its open situation, as it
„seldom grows in the neighbourhood of another tree. The eone
„is two and half inehes in length, and three and three quarters
„in its greatest circumferenee. It tapers regularly to a point,
„and is formed of the imbricated scales of a bluntly rounded form.
„A thin leaf is inserted in the pith of the eone, which overlays
„the eentre of, and extends half an ineh beyond the point of
„seale.“ Lewis and Clarke.

6. „ARIES FALCATA Raf. (Seu-enm Fir Lewis and Clarke), bark
„sealy, leaves tristichal or in 3 rows, in 2 rows upright, in
„lower row declinate falcate, all linear lanceolate, with trigone
„petiols. eones fusisorms obtuse at both ends. Only on the sea
„shore of Oregon, rising only 35 feet, leaves 3—4th ineh long,

„1 —5th wide.“ Raf.

„The seventh species grows in low grounds, and in places fre-
„quently overflown by the tide, seldom rising higher than thirty-
„five feet, and not more than from two and a half to four in
„diameterz the stem is simple, branehing and proliferous, the
„bark resembles that of the first speeies, but more rugged: the
„leaves 616 acerose, two-tenths' of an ineh in width, three-fourths
„in lenght, firm, stiff, and a little acuminated: they end in
„short pointed teudrils, gibbous, and thiekly seattered on all
„sides of the braneh, though they adhere to the three under
„sides only: those inserted on the under side incline sidewise,
„with upward points3 presenting the leaf in the shape of a sithe:

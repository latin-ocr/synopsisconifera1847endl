1. „ARIES TRIGONA Raf. Gigantic Fir. [First Fir Lewis and Clarke)
„bark and branches scaly‚ leaves densely scattered, petiolate tri—
„gone acuminate and stiff. -— Stated to be the largest tree of
„North-America7 some reaching 300 feet high, 200 without
„branehes, and 42 feet around. Petiols trigone also, leaves
„3-4ths of an inch long, 1-10th wide.“ Raf.

„The first species grows to an immense size, and is very
„commonly twenty-seven feet in circumference, six feet above
„the earth's surface: they rise to the height of two hundred and
„thirty feet, and one hundred and twenty of that height without
„a limb. We have often found them thirty-six feet in circum-
„ference. One of our party measured one, and found it to be
„forty-two feet in circumference, at a point beyond the reach
„of an ordinary man. This trunk for the distance of two hund-
„rcd feet was destitute of limbs3 this trec was perfectly sound,
„and at a moderate calculation its size may be estimated of three
„hundred feet. 'Phe timber is throughout, and rives better than
„any other species3 the bark scales off in flakes irregularly round,
„and of a reddish brown colour, particularly the younger growth.
„The trunk is simple, branching and not very proliferous. The
„leaf is acerose, one tenth of an inch in width, and three fourths
„in length, firm, st‘iff and acuminate. It is triangular, a little
„declining, thickly scattered on all sides of the bough, and springs
„from small triangular pedestals of soft, spongy, elastic bark
„at the junction of the boughs. 'Phe bud scales continue to en-
„eircle their respective twigs for several years. Captain Lewis
„has counted as many as the growth of four years beyond the
„scales. It yields but little rosin, and we have never been able
„to discover the cone, although we have killed several.“ Lewis

and Clarke.

2. „A131Es HETEROPHYLLA Raf. Odd leaved Fir. (Second Fir Lewis
„and marka), bark rimose, leaves distich-al petiolatc, very un-
„equal‚ sulcate above, glaucous hemath, eones terminal ovate

„the three under sides only, gibbous, a little deelining, obtusely
„pointed, soft and flexible. 'Phe upper disk is longitudinally
„marked with a slight ohannel, of a deep, glossy green 3 the
„under of a pale, not glossy green. This tree affords in eon-
„siderable quantities‚ a fine deep aromatie balsam, resembling
„the balsam of Canada in taste and appearance. 'Phe small pistils
„filled , rise like a blister on the trunk and the branches. 'rho
„bark, that envelops these pistils, is soft and easily pune-
„turedz the general appearance of the bark is dark and smooth:
„but not so remarkable for that quality as the white Pine of
„our country. 'Phe wood is white and soft.“ Lewz’s and Olarke.

4. ABIES MICROPHYLLA Raf. Small leaved Fir. (Fon-rth Fir Lewis
„and Clarke), bark rimose, branches not bullate, leaves densely
„seattered, forming 3 rows, sessile, sublanceolate, acute. —
„Reaehing 150 feet high. Like the last, but yielding no bal-
„sam, and with leaves still more minute, not lueid above, only
„1—12th of an ineh long, and 1—24th wide. VVood white and
„mugil-‘² Raf.

„The fourth speeies in size resembles the second. The stem is
„simple, branehing, aseending and proliferous3 the bark is of a
„reddish dark brown, and thieker than that os the third speeies,
„divided by small longitudinal interstiees, not so much magnified as
„in the second species. 'Phe relative position of the leaves resem-
„ble those of the baisam Fir, exeepting that they are only two-
„thirds the width, and little more than half the length, and that
„the upper disk is not so green and glossy. 'Phe wood yields no
„balsam, and but little rosin. The wood is white and tough,
„although rather porous.“ Lewis and Clariae.

5. „ARIES MUCRONATA Raf. (Fifth Fir Lewis and Clarke), bark
„scaly, branehes virgate, leaves seattered very narrow, rigid,
„and oblique, sulcate above, pale beneath. Cones ovate acute,
„scales rounded, nervose mucronatc.— Rises 150 feet, leaves sub-
„balsamie, one ineh long, 1—20t11 wide, eones very large, two
„and half ineh'es long.“— „Var. palustris. Grows in swamps,
„only 30 feet high, and with spreading b1·anchcs.“ llas.

„The fifth speeies in size resembles the second, and has a
„trunk simple, branching and proliferous. 'l‘he bark is osa thiu
